It is a school project. We made it during an intensive week. 

The subject of the topic is space. Our goal was to make a website using API's data.

#API used : 

	 - WebGL Earth, (3D earth) 
	 - NASA fireball, (position of the fireballs)
	 - REST Country, (country size area and population number)
	 - GeoNames (latitude, longitude and name of the country)

#Features : 

	- See meteors' locations on the globe
	- Click on a meteor's impact to see data about it :  mass, velocity, impact force, impact ray.
	- Change data of mass and velocity by moving the slider. 
	- See numbers of victims of an impact area. 
	- See comparison with the number of the death factors the most close to the number of victim. 
	- See the proportion. 
	- An astronaut explain how to use the website
