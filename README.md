# meteors

It is a school project. We made it during an intensive week. 

The subject of the topic is space. Our goal was to make a website using API's data.

API used : 
 - WebGL Earth, (3D earth) 
 - NASA fireball, (position of the fireballs)
 - REST Country, (country size area and population number)
 - GeoNames (latitude, longitude and name of the country)

This app shows you meteors' locations on the globe ! 
You can click on a meteor's impact to see data about it ( velocity, energy, mass ).
Then you can change this data ! It becomes a simulator where you can compare the number of victims of an impact area : by moving the slider of velocity or mass you can get a new impact strengh and a new number of victims.

Take a look to the left bottom. There is a ranking of various death factors of 2016 such as drugs, car crashes, etc.
Where do you situate on that list ?
