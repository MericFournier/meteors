# meteors
School project during an intensive week. 

This app show you meteors's location on the globe ! 
You can click a meteor's impact area to see data about the impact ( velocity, energy, masse )
The, you can change those data ! It becam a simulator that provide you to see what would happen
if that meteor you clicked would have been different ! 

You can't see how much people it would had hurt and allow you to compare it to many death facotrs in 201ยง ( as drugs, alcools, car crash etc.. ) 
Datas are collected with API's, it's the main goal of the project -> using at least 1 API ( from NASA ) !
